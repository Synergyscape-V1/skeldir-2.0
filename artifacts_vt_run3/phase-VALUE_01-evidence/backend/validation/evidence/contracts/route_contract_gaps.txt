=== Route-Contract Gap Analysis ===
Timestamp: 2025-11-20 13:50:00

=== Backend Routes Implemented ===
1. POST /api/auth/login (operationId: login)
2. POST /api/auth/refresh (operationId: refreshToken)
3. POST /api/auth/logout (operationId: logout)
4. GET /api/attribution/revenue/realtime (operationId: getRealtimeRevenue)
5. GET /health (out-of-scope)
6. GET / (out-of-scope)

=== Contract Operations (from bundled specs) ===
(See contract_operations_map.txt for full list)

Main Contracts:
- auth.bundled.yaml: 3 operations (login, refresh, logout)
- attribution.bundled.yaml: 1+ operations
- export.bundled.yaml: operations defined
- health.bundled.yaml: operations defined
- reconciliation.bundled.yaml: operations defined
- webhooks.*.bundled.yaml: operations defined

=== Gap Analysis ===

Routes WITHOUT Contracts:
- None identified (all implemented routes have corresponding contracts)

Contracts WITHOUT Backend Implementation:
- Export operations (no backend/app/api/export.py)
- Reconciliation operations (no backend/app/api/reconciliation.py)
- Health API operations (no backend/app/api/health.py)
- Webhook operations (no backend/app/api/webhooks.py)

=== Status ===
Current implementation: PARTIAL
- Auth API: Implemented
- Attribution API: Partially implemented (1 endpoint)
- Export API: Not implemented
- Reconciliation API: Not implemented
- Health API: Not implemented (only generic /health endpoint)
- Webhooks API: Not implemented

This is EXPECTED for Phase B0.1 baseline. Full implementation is not required yet.
Evidence captured for contract-first enforcement validation.
