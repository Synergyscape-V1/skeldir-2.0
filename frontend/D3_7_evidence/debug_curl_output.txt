D3.7 Investigation Protocol — Step A: Network & Path Diagnostics

Curl was not executed because:
- Storybook dev server prompted for port 6007 (6006 in use) and exited in non-interactive mode
- Build-storybook was used instead to capture the actual failure

  Rollup failed to resolve import "@radix-ui/react-select" from select.tsx
  → Missing npm dependency, not path/HTTP issue
