D3.7 Investigation — Vite Build Error (BEFORE FIX)

Command: npm run build-storybook

Error trace:
---
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "@radix-ui/react-select" from
"C:/Users/ayewhy/II SKELDIR II/frontend/src/components/ui/select.tsx".
This is most likely unintended because it can break your application
at runtime.
If you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to
`build.rollupOptions.external`
---

Root cause: @radix-ui/react-select was listed in shadcn primitives inventory
but the package was never installed. shadcn-theme.stories.tsx imports
Select from @/components/ui/select, which requires @radix-ui/react-select.

Post-fix: npm run build-storybook completes successfully.
  ✓ canonical-data-table.stories-CrZWglWv.js built (62.41 kB)
