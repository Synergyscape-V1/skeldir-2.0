      summary: Shopify order creation webhook
      description: |
        Receives Shopify order creation webhooks for revenue attribution.
        
        **Security**: This endpoint validates HMAC-SHA256 signatures using the X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256 header.
        The webhook secret must be configured in the tenant settings.
        
        **Privacy**: All PII (emails, names, addresses, phone numbers) is stripped from the payload before persistence.
        No storage of personally identifiable information occurs. Only session-scoped data is retained for attribution purposes.
        Session IDs are ephemeral (30-minute inactivity timeout) and are NOT used for cross-session tracking.
