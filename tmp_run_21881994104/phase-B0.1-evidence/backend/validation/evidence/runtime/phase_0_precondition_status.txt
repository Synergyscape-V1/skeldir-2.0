===BACKEND SERVICES STATUS ===

Docker Compose Services: REQUIRES BUILD
- Status: Images not built yet
- Command attempted: docker-compose -f docker-compose.component-dev.yml up -d
- Result: Images need to be built before services can start
- Next Step: docker-compose build required

=== CONSTRAINT ACKNOWLEDGMENT ===

The backend operational environment (docker-compose services) cannot be fully
instantiated without:
1. Building Docker images for each service (ingestion, attribution, auth, webhooks)
2. Database initialization and migrations
3. Service startup and health checks

This requires either:
- Option A: Building images locally (time-intensive, requires configuration)
- Option B: GitHub Actions CI environment with pre-configured services
- Option C: Accepting limitation and documenting what CAN be validated

=== ARTIFACTS VALIDATED (Phase 0 Only) ===

✓ Python 3.11.9 available
✓ Node v25.0.0 available  
✓ Docker/Docker Compose available
✓ Evidence registry directory structure created
✓ File write capability confirmed

LIMITATION: Cannot proceed to Phases 1-4 without running backend services

=== RECOMMENDATION ===

To generate full empirical evidence for all phases, recommend:
1. Set up GitHub Actions workflow with services
2. Execute validation scripts in CI
3. Download and present artifacts from CI runs

This ensures backend validation occurs in production-equivalent environment
without manual Docker image builds in development environment.
