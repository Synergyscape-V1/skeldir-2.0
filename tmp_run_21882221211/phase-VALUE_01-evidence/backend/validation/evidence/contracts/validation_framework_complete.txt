=== Contract Validation Framework Complete ===
Timestamp: 2025-11-20 14:05:00

Phase E: Contract Authority Restoration

=== Artifacts Created ===

1. scripts/contracts/validate-contracts.sh:
   - Bundles contracts using existing bundle.sh
   - Validates OpenAPI syntax with openapi-generator-cli
   - Detects breaking changes with oasdiff (if available)
   - Produces machine-readable validation reports

2. tests/contract/test_route_fidelity.py:
   - Imports FastAPI app programmatically
   - Extracts all routes and operation IDs
   - Parses bundled OpenAPI contracts
   - Asserts 1:1 mapping between routes and contracts
   - Identifies unmapped routes or operations
   - Validates operation ID consistency

=== Validation Capabilities ===

Contract Syntax Validation:
- Uses @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli
- Validates all bundled contracts in api-contracts/dist/openapi/v1/
- Checks YAML syntax, schema structure, examples

Breaking Change Detection:
- Uses oasdiff (if installed)
- Compares current contracts against baselines
- Identifies breaking vs non-breaking changes
- Documents change impact

Route Fidelity Testing:
- Programmatic route extraction from FastAPI
- Contract scope awareness (in-scope vs out-of-scope)
- Operation ID matching
- Gap analysis (routes without contracts, contracts without routes)

=== Current State ===

Validation Framework: IMPLEMENTED
Execution Status: Requires FastAPI runtime (dependencies not fully installed)

Expected Results (when executed):
- validate-contracts.sh: Validates all bundled OpenAPI specs
- test_route_fidelity.py: Maps 4 implemented routes to contracts
- Gap analysis shows unimplemented operations (expected in B0.1)

=== Evidence Deferred ===

NOTE: Actual validation execution deferred - requires:
- FastAPI and dependencies installed
- Python environment with pyyaml, pytest
- Node.js with openapi-generator-cli

Framework implementation: COMPLETE
Evidence capture: DEFERRED to integration phase

Phase E deliverable: COMPLETE (validation tooling implemented)
Next: Phase F (Interim semantics implementation)
