=== Runtime Privacy Validation ===
Timestamp: 2025-11-20T20:25:00Z
Environment: backend/.venv311 (Python 3.11.9)

Test: FastAPI TestClient exercising PIIStrippingMiddleware
Request:
POST /echo
Content-Type: application/json
Payload:
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "nested": {
    "phone": "555-1212"
  }
}

Expected: Middleware replaces values for keys [email, phone] with "[REDACTED]"
Actual Response Body:
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "nested": {
    "phone": "555-1212"
  }
}

Result: FAIL - middleware did not modify payload; request data reached handler unchanged.
Evidence Command:
$env:PYTHONPATH='backend'; <script piped to backend/.venv311/Scripts/python.exe>

Notes:
- Middleware reads body and sets custom receive hook but never invalidates the cached request body.
- FastAPI handlers continue to see the original JSON; PII redaction layer is ineffective.
- Database trigger validation still pending because runtime layer failed.
